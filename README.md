# Christopher Fonseca — Embedded Systems & Computer Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a computer engineering student focused on **embedded systems**, **firmware**, **robotics**, and **mechatronic design**.  
I build real hardware, write low-level code, and enjoy solving physical + computational problems.
